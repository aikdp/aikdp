👋 Hi, I'm Durga Prasad Kodipathina, a passionate DevOps Engineer with nearly 3 years of experience designing, building, and scaling cloud-native infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.

🔧 My toolkit includes AWS, Terraform, Jenkins CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes and Ansible with a strong foundation in Linux, shell scripting and cloud automation.

🚀 I specialize in:

Building highly efficient, automated CI/CD workflows using Jenkins and GitHub.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, ensuring secure and scalable cloud environments.

Containerization and orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes.

Implementing DevSecOps practices with tools like SonarQube, OWASP and security-first automation.

Monitoring and observability with Prometheus, Grafana and the ELK Stack.

Optimizing deployments, scaling infrastructure and solving real-world production challenges.

🛠️ I'm passionate about automation, cloud architecture, and continuous learning. Always exploring new technologies to build reliable, scalable, and secure systems.

🌱 Currently, I'm focused on mastering multi-cloud strategies, advanced Kubernetes operations, and serverless architectures.

Let's connect, collaborate and build something amazing together! 🚀
